Foamicate-Demo
==============

This is the demo site to show off the capabilities of Foamicate
authentication. It also serves as an example of how to add support for
Faomicate. It uses the [Foamicatee-PHP library](https://github.com/romaimperator/Foamicatee-PHP).

Assuming that your server has PHP installed, you should be able to drop
this code into your web folder and have your own demo site up and
running.
